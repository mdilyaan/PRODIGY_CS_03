Password Complexity Checker - Building a password strength assessment tool involves analyzing various aspects of a password, such as its length, character types, and patterns. My code considers the length of the password, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The assessment is categorized into "Weak", "Moderate", "Strong", and "Very Strong" based on the score calculated from the criteria.

You can adjust the criteria and scoring system based on your specific requirements and security standards. Additionally, you may want to include additional checks for common passwords, dictionary words, or patterns to enhance the tool's effectiveness.

Observations: 1.Password complexity is checked keeping following things on mind: (i)Length (ii)Presence of uppercase letteres (iii)Presenece of lowercase letters (iv)Presence of Numbers (v)Presence of Special Characters

Outcome: (i)Learned how password can be cracked (ii)Learned how common password can lead to quicker access of credentials by a hacker
